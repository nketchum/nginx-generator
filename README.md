# nginx-generator #

Easy simple way to create Nginx vhost files for fairly simple sites, such as a proxy to a Node.js server, a redirect
from one domain to another, serving a static site or setting up a config to serve multiple static sites from one
directory.

## Synopsis ##

To install:

```bash
$ npm install -g nginx-generator
```

To generate a simple redirect from `www.chilts.org` to `chilts.org`, just do:

```bash
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-www \
      --domain www.chilts.org \
      --type redirect \
      --var to=chilts.org \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-www
```

Then reload Nginx

```bash
$ sudo service nginx reload
```

Your vars can also be read from a JSON file, such as this:

```bash
$ echo '{"to":"chilts.org"}' > vars.json
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-www \
      --domain www.chilts.org \
      --type redirect \
      --data vars.json \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-www
```

## Proxy ##

To generate a proxy that will forward requests elsewhere, just pass the usual three `--name`, `--domain` and `--type`
then pass both `host` and `port` as `--var` variables:

```
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts \
      --domain chilts.org \
      --type proxy \
      --var host=localhost \
      --var port=8000 \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts
```

## Static Site ##

To generate a vhost that will serve a static site, just pass the usual three `--name`, `--domain` and `--type` then
pass `dir` as a `--var`:

```
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-static \
      --domain static-chilts.org \
      --type static \
      --var dir=/home/chilts/htdocs \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-static
```

## Redirect ##

To generate a redirect, just pass the usual three `--name`, `--domain` and `--type` then pass `to` as a `--var`:

```bash
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-www \
      --domain www.chilts.org \
      --type redirect \
      --var to=chilts.org \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-www
```

## Catchall (for multiple static sites) ##

To generate a catchall for multiple static sites, create a directory which will hold all of the sites, then create a
directory for each site, named after the host it will serve. For example, this will serve `example.com`, `chilts.org`
and `nodejs.nz`:

```sh
$ mkdir /var/lib/sites
$ mkdir /var/lib/sites/example.com
$ mkdir /var/lib/sites/chilts.org
$ mkdir /var/lib/sites/nodejs.nz
```

Then, create this special vhost config:

```bash
$ nginx-generator \
      --name vhost \
      --domain _ \
      --type vhost \
      --var dir=/var/lib/sites \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/vhost
```

## DRUPAL 8 ##

To generate a single Drupal 8 installation, pass the usual three `--name`, `--domain` and `--type` then
pass `dir` as a `--var`:

```
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-drupal8 \
      --domain static-drupal8.org \
      --type drupal8 \
      --var dir=/home/chilts/htdocs \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-drupal8
```

## Roadmap ##

* add ability to set and define config for basic auth for any site
* add ability to make a site serve over https with config for certs

## Other Nginx Packages ##

There are some other Nginx packages out there such as:

* https://www.npmjs.org/package/nginx-vhosts
* https://www.npmjs.org/package/ngineer
* https://www.npmjs.org/package/nginx-conf
* https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodeginx

However, I didn't want to control Nginx itself like `nginx-vhosts` and `ngineer` does, especially on Debian or Ubuntu
machines since upstart already does this. All I wanted to do was template in some simple vhosts in a programmatic
(library or CLI program) way. Also, `nginx-conf` is too complicated since that's for the main Nginx config. `nodeginx`
is closest to this package in terms of functionality.
